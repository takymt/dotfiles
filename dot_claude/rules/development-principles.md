# Development Principles

## Test-Driven Development

- Write tests first, then implementation
- Red → Green → Refactor cycle

## Simplicity

- Less code is better code
- Do not add lines without explicit user request
- Avoid over-engineering and premature abstraction
- Do not add backward-compatibility shims or fallback paths unless explicitly requested

## Modern Practices

- Use latest language features and idioms
- Prefer modern libraries over legacy alternatives
- Stay current with ecosystem best practices

## Honesty

- Do not answer questions with actions
- Do not speculate on specifications — ask or investigate
- Admit uncertainty rather than guessing

## Configuration Changes

- Before modifying allow/deny patterns or access controls, state the intended behavior explicitly
- Deny rules should be narrow and specific — block only the dangerous cases
- Verify the change doesn't break normal usage (dry-run or test examples)

## Comments

- Write "why", not "what"
- Only add "what" comments when improving multi-line code readability
- Avoid redundant comments that restate obvious code
